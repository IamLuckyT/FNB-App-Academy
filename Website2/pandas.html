                    Pandas are native to China and are known for their distinctive black and white fur.
                    They belongs to the order Carnivora and primarily feed on bamboo, which makes up 99% of their diet.
                    Pandas are solitary animals, but they can be seen in pairs during the breeding season.

                    The giant panda <b>(Ailuropoda melanoleuca)</b> also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south central China. 
                    It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. 
                    The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. 
                    Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. 
                    In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, 
                    but also in neighbouring provinces, namely Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, 
                    the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.
                    The giant panda is a conservation reliant endangered species.
